# Clipboard Ninja

Are any of these stories relatable?

- You often paste URLs to things, but don't want to include all the tracking information
- You pasted an <abbr title="Twitter">X</abbr> or Tiktok link to Discord, but it didn't embed properly,
  so now you have to change the domain, so it can embed

Various workflows can be automated by watching the clipboard and replacing its contents,
and thus the clipboard ninja was born.
